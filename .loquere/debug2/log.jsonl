Attic Greek was the dialect spoken in ancient Athens during the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, characterized by complex grammar and vocabulary. Koine Greek, on the other hand, emerged later as a more simplified and standardized form of Greek, used as a lingua franca during the Hellenistic period. The main differences between Attic and Koine Greek lie in their grammar, vocabulary, and syntax, with Koine being more straightforward and less ornate.\n\nTo provide a more detailed comparison:\n* Grammar: Koine has simpler verb conjugations and fewer irregularities.\n* Vocabulary: Koine has adopted words from other languages, while Attic is more purist.\n* Syntax: Koine sentence structure is generally more straightforward.\n\nHere's a summary in a table format:\n\n| Aspect | Attic Greek | Koine Greek |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Time period | 5th-4th centuries BCE | 3rd century BCE - 3rd century CE |\n| Grammar | Complex conjugations, irregularities | Simplified conjugations |\n| Vocabulary | Purist, fewer loanwords | Adopted words from other languages |\n| Syntax | More complex sentence structure | Straightforward sentence structure |", "cost": 0.0, "usage": {"groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct": {"text/out": 259, "text/in": 2310}}}
