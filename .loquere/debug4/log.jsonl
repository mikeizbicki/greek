The series targets children aged 6-10 and is designed to be flexible and accessible for early readers and neurodiverse learners. The stories feature a small, recurring cast of characters, community and creatures, and lively settings that invite talk, while exploring values such as courage, wisdom, and hospitality. The series aims to nurture comprehension, delight, and character in learners, making Greek a living voice rather than a list of rules. Key features include visual scaffolds, spiral design, multimodal access, and embedded activities that encourage curiosity and respectful comparison.", "cost": 0.0, "usage": {"cerebras/llama-3.3-70b": {"text/out": 159, "text/in": 4207}, "_tool/read_file": {"text/out": 12, "text/in": 1664}}}
