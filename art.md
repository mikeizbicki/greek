# Artwork Style Guide

Soft picture-book watercolor/gouache: semi-flat shapes, gentle dry-brush textures, clear silhouettes, generous white space.
Greek palette: terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, warm cream, with quiet gold accents; soft, consistent daylight and warm edge lighting.
Use subtle classical accents (meander borders, olive leaves, amphora silhouettes) sparingly; friendly rounded characters with big readable expressions and minimal line detail.
