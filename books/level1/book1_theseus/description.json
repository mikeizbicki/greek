  "plot": "Theseus leaves home to go to the market for bread and water. At a crossroads he avoids monsters on the mountain, in the forest, and in the cave, and chooses the safe field road. He reaches the agora, buys bread and water, eats and drinks, and thanks the marketman.",
  "art_instructions": "Show Theseus at a four-way crossroads, the safe green field path leading toward a sunny agora, with small distant silhouettes hinting at the Sphinx in the mountain, the Cyclops in the forest, and Cerberus at a cave. Keep shapes clear, friendly, and non-threatening; warm daylight, simple landmarks (doorway, stall, jar of water, loaf of bread).",
