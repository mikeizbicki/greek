  "art_instructions": "Inside a small Greek-style room, show warm cream plaster walls and a terracotta floor in soft watercolor. Use a child’s-eye, three-quarter view so we see a simple wooden table on the left and an open doorway on the right. On the table, place a single round clay plate that is clearly empty (no loaf) and one upright clay cup that looks empty; include no pitcher or other food to emphasize ‘no bread, no water.’ Center-left, Theseus the small brown-and-olive owl stands on a low stool beside the table, body angled toward the tabletop, head turned toward the door; his beak is slightly open as if speaking, one wing rests on his belly (hungry), and the other gestures toward the doorway (ready to go). He is not wearing his cloak indoors; instead, hang his olive-green travel cloak on a peg by the door with a light leather pouch and a thin red cord peeking from it. Through the open door on the right, show soft daylight and only a distant hint of the village—two pale market awnings suggesting the agora, with no figures yet. Keep lighting gentle morning sun from the doorway, giving warm edge light on Theseus and calm shadows; use the Greek palette (terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, warm cream) and a subtle meander border painted along the table edge. Shapes should be semi-flat and friendly with clear silhouettes and minimal line detail; mood: a little hungry but determined to go buy bread and water.",
