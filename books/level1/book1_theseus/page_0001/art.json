  "art_instructions": "Three-quarter view from slightly above to show a small Athenian-style room: cream plaster walls, terracotta floor, and a small window with Aegean blue sky. Center-left stands a low rectangular wooden table (trapeza) with a single upright clay cup (potÄ“rion) clearly empty; no bread is on the table, and a little wicker bread basket lies tipped on its side to emphasize the absence. On the right foreground, Theseus (a small brown-and-olive owl) faces the table but turns his body toward a doorway, one wing touching his belly (hungry/thirsty) and the other wing slightly extended as if about to go. His beak is slightly open as if speaking; his expression is determined but gentle. He wears an olive-green travel cloak and a small leather pouch at his side; a thin red cord peeks from the pouch. Place an open doorway on the left background with warm sunlight spilling in and a glimpse of a sunlit lane leading toward the agora; no people outside yet. Keep the table top about chest-height to Theseus so his gaze clearly meets the cup; the cup should be small and plainly empty. Use soft watercolor/gouache with the Greek palette (terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, warm cream) and add a subtle meander border motif on a wall niche or amphora in the corner, kept minimal.",
