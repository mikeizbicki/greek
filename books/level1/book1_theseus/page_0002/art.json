  "art_instructions": "Full-page watercolor scene of Theseus the small owl at the threshold of his house, stepping out toward a sunlit dirt road. Camera at child-eye height from slightly inside the doorway, so the open wooden door frames the left edge and the road is clearly visible just a few steps ahead. Theseus stands centered on the sill, body angled left toward the road, one talon on the doorstep and the other lifted mid-step; wings tucked, head forward with a calm, eager expression. He wears his olive-green travel cloak and a small side pouch; a thin red cord loops neatly from his pouch or leg. Outside, the simple dirt road runs left to right across the foreground and bends gently into the distance; include one low olive tree and a small stone marker beside the path to make the road unmistakable. Keep the interior behind him very simple—warm cream wall and soft floor shadow—so the action “going out” reads clearly. Morning light spills in with warm edge highlights on Theseus and the door; use the Greek palette (terracotta walls, olive greens, Aegean blue sky) with soft, semi-flat textures. No other characters, signs, or crossroads yet—only the single road ahead.",
