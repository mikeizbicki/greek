  "art_instructions": "Medium‑wide, slightly elevated view of a plus‑shaped crossroads just outside a simple stone house door, so we see where Theseus has come from. Theseus, a small mottled brown‑and‑olive owl in an olive‑green travel cloak with a thin red cord at one leg and a small leather pouch, stands at the very center of the crossing, head tilted, wings slightly open, with a thoughtful, curious expression. Make the four roads clearly distinct by color and destination: upper‑left road climbs toward a gray rocky hill/mountain; upper‑right road enters a dark green forest arch; lower‑left road slopes toward a low shadowed cave mouth in a grassy mound; lower‑right road stretches through a sunny golden field toward faint, friendly shapes hinting at a distant market (light awnings and a few posts, no people yet). Place a simple low signpost or four flat milestone stones at the junction, each with a clear pictogram (triangle for mountain, tree for forest, arch for cave, grain stalk for field) pointing along its path. Keep shapes large and readable for children, with generous white space around the crossroads and clear silhouettes. Soft daylight with warm cream sky and gentle, consistent shadows; Greek palette of terracotta path edges, olive greens, Aegean blue hints, and warm cream stone. No monsters or other figures appear—this moment focuses on the idea ‘here there are four roads.’",
