  "art_instructions": "Scene: a four-way crossroads under soft midday light, viewed from a slightly elevated 3/4 angle so all paths are clear. In the exact center stands Theseus, a small mottled brown‑and‑olive owl in a simple olive-green travel cloak, red cord looped at one leg, and a tiny leather pouch; he faces slightly toward the lower-right path with head tilted, wings relaxed and half-open in a thinking pose, calm and curious expression. Place four distinct paths radiating like an X: top-left path climbs into a cool gray-blue mountain with a visible cut-through notch/tunnel in the rock; top-right path enters a dense olive-green forest with tree trunks forming an arch overhead; bottom-left path descends toward a rocky hill with a dark cave mouth the path goes through; bottom-right path crosses a warm golden field with low grasses and a few red poppies. At the start of each path, set a small flat milestone stone labeled with a clear number (1 by the mountain path, 2 by the forest path, 3 by the cave path, 4 by the field path) so children can map πρώτη/δευτέρα/τρίτη/τετάρτη to the directions. Keep monsters absent; only simple, friendly silhouettes of landscape features. Palette: terracotta earth at the crossroads, olive greens, Aegean blue sky, warm cream highlights, and quiet gold edge lighting on Theseus’s feathers. Composition balance: Theseus about one-sixth of image height; mountain and forest background shapes larger but softened; field path brightest and most open to subtly suggest safety, while the cave entrance is darkest but not frightening.",
