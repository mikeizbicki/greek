  "art_instructions": "Show a sunlit rocky mountain slope with a clear path that rises from the bottom left toward a soft, dark tunnel opening set into the mountain at mid-right. Place Theseus (a small brown-and-olive owl with an olive-green travel cloak and a light leather pouch, a thin red cord looped at one leg) in the lower left foreground, mid-step on the path, body angled up and to the right toward the tunnel. Use a three-quarter view with a slightly low camera angle so the mountain feels larger than Theseus; make Theseus about one-eighth the image height to show scale. His wings are tucked, head tilted forward with calm, curious eyes—determined but not afraid. Keep the tunnel mouth wide enough and darker than the sunlit path so the idea of “into the mountain” is unmistakable, but avoid anything frightening inside. Add a few olive shrubs and a small stone milestone with a subtle meander motif near the path for Greek flavor without clutter. Warm daylight with gentle edge lighting; palette of terracotta rocks, warm cream path, olive greens, and Aegean blue sky; soft watercolor textures and clear silhouettes.",
