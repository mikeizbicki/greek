  "art_instructions": "Wide scene of a rocky mountain path under soft midday light. The path comes up from the bottom left, curves toward a narrow pass at mid‑right, where the Sphinx sits squarely on a flat stone ledge, clearly blocking the way. The Sphinx has a lion’s sand‑gold body, warm umber mane, feathered ivory wings half‑open in a warning pose, and a calm human face with a firm, serious expression (no bared teeth). Tail is wrapped neatly around her paws; she is large enough to fill the pass and feel imposing but not frightening. Surroundings: pale cream sky, Aegean blue distance, scrubby olive tufts and a carved milestone stone near the ledge with a simple meander mark. Camera angle slightly below the ledge so the Sphinx feels commanding; no traveler is visible yet. Use soft watercolor/gouache textures, Greek palette, gentle warm edge lighting; clear silhouettes and child‑friendly details to suggest “fierce” through posture and wings rather than aggression.",
