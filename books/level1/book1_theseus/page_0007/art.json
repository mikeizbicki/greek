  "art_instructions": "Soft watercolor/gouache scene in warm daylight on a rocky mountain path in the mountains. Left foreground: the Sphinx sits on a flat, carved stone that blocks the narrow path; right midground: Theseus (a small owl) has stopped on the path’s edge facing her. Camera at child eye-level, three-quarter view looking slightly upslope from right to left so the Sphinx feels higher and larger. The Sphinx has a sand-gold lion body, a calm human face, and ivory feathered wings half-unfurled; her tail is neatly wrapped, and she is about three times Theseus’s height (larger than a donkey, smaller than a cart). She lowers her head toward Theseus with mouth gently open as she speaks; show a rounded speech ribbon near her face with the exact Greek «πεινῶ καὶ σὲ φαγεῖν θέλω.» and small, subtle belly-rumble lines to suggest hunger, not menace. Theseus is a mottled brown-and-olive owl wearing an olive-green travel cloak with a light leather pouch at his side; a thin red cord peeks from the pouch. He leans back with one foot lifted, feathers slightly puffed, one wing half-raised toward his ear as if hearing; his wide amber eyes and small open beak show fear, but he is unhurt. Surroundings: gray-olive rocks, a few tufts of thyme, and a small olive shrub; warm cream sky with a distant Aegean-blue ridge; gentle warm edge lighting; the Sphinx’s stone perch may have a faint meander border. Keep expressions readable and non-gruesome, with clear silhouettes and generous white space so children can match βλέπει/λέγει/ἀκούει/φοβεῖται to the actions.",
