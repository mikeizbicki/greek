  "art_instructions": "A sunlit mountain path at a gentle three‑quarter view slopes down to the right, with warm cream sky and distant Aegean‑blue hills. On the left, the Sphinx (sand‑gold lion body, human face, ivory wings) sits upright on a carved stone block that partly blocks the narrow path; her tail is neatly wrapped and her wings are half‑raised as a warning. She fills the left third of the image, facing right toward Theseus with a calm, stern expression. Center‑right, Theseus (a small owl with mottled brown‑olive feathers) is caught mid‑step turning away downhill: his body faces down‑right while his head looks back toward the Sphinx, beak slightly open as he speaks. He wears an olive‑green travel cloak and a light leather pouch; a thin red cord peeks from the pouch, and one wing gestures politely outward. A faint puff of dust by his feet and the path leading out of frame to the right show he is leaving the mountain. Sparse rocks and little olive tufts edge the trail; the Sphinx’s block bears a simple meander motif, with soft shadows keeping shapes clear and non‑threatening. Child‑eye camera height, soft watercolor/gouache textures and Greek palette; keep generous open sky or ground for a small speech bubble if needed.",
