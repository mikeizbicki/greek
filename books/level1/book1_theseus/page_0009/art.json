  "art_instructions": "Paint a mid-wide, eye-level scene at the edge of a friendly forest in soft watercolor. On the left foreground, Theseus the small owl-hero stands mid-step, his front talon already on the shaded path under the first trees while his back foot remains in sunlit grass, clearly showing movement into the forest. He wears his olive-green travel cloak, a light leather pouch at his side, and a thin red cord looped at one leg; wings tucked, head slightly turned toward the deeper path with a calm, determined expression. The dirt path runs from the bright meadow at left into the trees at right, where branches form a leafy arch like a doorway; dappled light and cooler greens suggest the interior. Place a simple wooden marker or milestone at the path’s mouth with a small leaf symbol to signal “forest,” avoiding written letters. In the far left background, include a faint rocky hill and a tiny crossroads stone he came from, both small and quiet for continuity. No monsters or other figures are visible; the forest feels peaceful but unknown. Use the Greek palette: warm cream sunlight at the edge, olive and Aegean blues in the shadows, with gentle warm edge lighting on Theseus.",
