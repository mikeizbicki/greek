  "art_instructions": "Create a sunlit forest path in olive greens and warm terracotta earth, viewed in a medium‑wide shot from child height with a slight low angle. Center the Cyclops on the path, large enough to fill about two‑thirds of the page height, clearly blocking the way. He is a towering, broad‑shouldered man with one large eye, shaggy hair, a thick beard, a rough wool tunic tied with a simple belt, and plain sandals. He holds a heavy wooden staff horizontally across the path with both hands, feet planted apart, stance firm and immovable. His single eye is narrowed with angled brows and a tight mouth—reading as fierce but not gruesome; keep expressions big and readable. Surround him with tall pines and oaks that arch overhead, with soft, dappled daylight and generous white space around his silhouette. Add a small goatskin water‑flask at his belt and a few broken twigs or scuffed leaves at his feet to show he has just stepped into the path; no other characters appear. Use the series palette (olive, Aegean blue hints in shadow, warm cream sky, quiet gold edge light) and soft watercolor textures.",
