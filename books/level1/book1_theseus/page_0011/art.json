  "art_instructions": "Scene: a sun-dappled forest road with olive and pine trunks, soft ferns, and a clear dirt path running left-to-right. Place Theseus (small brown-olive owl with an olive-green travel cloak, leather pouch, and a thin red cord peeking from the pouch) in the lower left foreground, about one-sixth the frame height, stepping back on the path with wings tucked in, feathers slightly fluffed, beak a little open, and wide amber eyes showing fear; add two tiny tremble marks near his body. On the right, place the Cyclops dominating the scene (about two-thirds of the frame height, half the width), three to four steps away from Theseus to leave clear space between them; he is broad-shouldered, with a single expressive eye, thick beard, rough wool tunic, belt, simple sandals, and a heavy wooden staff held upright in his left hand. The Cyclops’s right hand rests on his belly to show hunger; his mouth is open mid-speech, eyebrows lowered but not cruel—big, readable, non-gory features; keep shapes rounded and friendly. Add a simple beige speech ribbon from the Cyclops, clearly lettered in Greek: «πεινῶ καὶ σὲ φαγεῖν θέλω.» Keep the camera at a slightly low angle to emphasize the Cyclops’s height while keeping both figures fully visible (three-quarter view). Let warm midday light filter through leaves (Aegean blue-greens, terracotta-browns, warm cream highlights) with soft edges and generous white space around the figures. The road should continue behind Theseus toward the left background to hint at an escape route he can take on the next page. Watercolor/gouache texture, clear silhouettes, no harsh shadows or frightening detail.",
