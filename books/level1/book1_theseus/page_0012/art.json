  "art_instructions": "Medium-wide, eye-level scene at the edge of a forest: on the left, the Cyclops stands in cool, dappled shade among tree trunks; on the right, bright sunlight opens to a clear path where Theseus is stepping out of the trees. Theseus is a small owl in an olive-green travel cloak with a tiny red cord visible at one leg and a light leather pouch; he is mid‑turn toward the sunlit path, head looking back toward the Cyclops, beak open, one wing slightly raised to indicate departure. A small speech ribbon from Theseus reads: «οὐδαμῶς· πορεύσομαι διὰ ἄλλης ὁδοῦ.» The Cyclops is much larger (about 2–3× Theseus’s height), broad‑shouldered with one expressive eye, shaggy hair and beard, rough wool tunic, simple sandals, and a heavy wooden staff held low and non-threatening across his body; his brow is surprised rather than angry. Include a goatskin water-flask at his belt and a single goat peeking curiously from behind a tree to soften the mood. Light transitions left-to-right from forest shade to warm cream sunshine on the open path, guiding the eye to Theseus’s exit; keep backgrounds simple (olive leaves, ferns, soft trunks) with generous white space. Palette and rendering follow the watercolor/gouache style guide: terracotta, olive, Aegean blue accents, warm cream, soft edges, clear silhouettes. Expressions are big and readable: Theseus calm and resolved; Cyclops puzzled but not hostile.",
