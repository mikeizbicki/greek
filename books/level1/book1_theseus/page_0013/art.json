  "art_instructions": "Eye-level, medium-wide view of a rocky hillside where a dark cave mouth dominates the left two-thirds of the page; a sunlit footpath enters from the right and leads straight to the opening. Theseus, a small brown-and-olive owl with an olive-green travel cloak and a light leather pouch, is placed in the lower right third, about one-fifth the page height, mid-step as he goes inside. One talon crosses the shadow line of the cave, the other still on the sunlit path; one wing extends slightly forward for balance, and his head tilts toward the darkness with calm, alert eyes (curious, not frightened). A thin red cord loops around one leg, and a tiny wooden ship pendant peeks at his chest for continuity. Lighting is clear: warm sunlight on the rocks and the back edge of Theseus, cool blue-gray inside the cave; the inside/outside boundary is a crisp, readable line. Surroundings are simple Greek landscape touchesâ€”terracotta stones, a few olive leaves around the cave rim, and small dust footprints on the path pointing into the cave; no monsters are visible. Soft watercolor/gouache with gentle textures and clear silhouettes; keep shapes friendly and non-threatening.",
