  "art_instructions": "Inside a dim cave chamber, place Cerberus centered and large in the foreground, shown three-quarters facing to the right. He is a shaggy black three‑headed hound wearing a thick bronze‑studded collar; the middle head looks stern with lips slightly curled, the left head leans forward sniffing toward the light, and the right head looks drowsy with half‑closed eyes. Set the camera at child eye level, slightly low, so he feels big but not overwhelming; his broad paws grip the rocky floor and his heavy tail rests on the ground. Let pale daylight spill in from a cave opening on the left, rim‑lighting his fur with warm cream while the cave’s interior falls into cool blue‑gray shadows. Add simple cave details: a few stalactites above, a flat gate‑stone behind him, scattered pebbles, and a small amphora near the wall to show scale. Place an old bone toy near one paw as a gentle touch, but keep his posture still, watchful, and “fierce” rather than attacking. Do not show Theseus or any speech; the scene simply reveals that in the cave there is a fearsome monster, Cerberus.",
