  "art_instructions": "Inside a dim cave, frame the scene with the bright oval of the entrance at the far left, casting warm edge light across cool gray stone. Foreground left: Theseus, a small mottled brown‑and‑olive owl in an olive‑green travel cloak, stands on a flat rock facing right, body leaning back with wings slightly lifted, beak a little open, wide amber eyes showing fear. Midground right, blocking the tunnel: Cerberus, an enormous shaggy black three‑headed hound with a bronze‑studded collar; the center head faces Theseus with mouth partly open as if speaking, the left head tilts curiously, and the right head looks sleepy with half‑closed eyes; amber eyes glow softly. Make Cerberus about two‑thirds of the image height, while Theseus is roughly one‑fourth the dog’s height to show the size contrast. Add a simple speech ribbon from the center head with the Koine line «πεινῶ καὶ σὲ φαγεῖν θέλω.» in clear lettering, with gentle sound lines toward Theseus to suggest he hears. Use an eye‑level camera with Theseus (a slight low angle toward Cerberus) so he feels big but not gruesome; keep silhouettes clean and expressions readable. Color in soft watercolor: cool cave blues and grays, warm cream rim light from the entrance, and quiet gold glints on the collar. Include minimal cave details—smooth stones, a low carved gate‑stone behind Cerberus, and a clear, uncluttered floor—so the figures and emotions are the focus.",
