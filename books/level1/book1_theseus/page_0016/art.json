  "art_instructions": "Inside a dim cave, show a 3/4 view looking toward the bright cave mouth on the left, at a child’s eye level, wide enough to include both figures full‑body. On the right, Cerberus fills the right half: an enormous shaggy black three‑headed hound with a bronze‑studded collar; the middle head faces forward sternly, the left head tilts toward Theseus with curious eyes, and the right head looks drowsy; big paws planted on stone with an old bone toy near one paw; tail lowered, not attacking. Near the left-middle, place Theseus, a small brown‑and‑olive owl about one‑third the height of Cerberus’s shoulder, wearing an olive‑green travel cloak and a small leather pouch, with a thin red cord peeking at one leg. Theseus stands two steps from the sunlit exit, body angled out toward the light but head turned back to Cerberus; beak open as he speaks, one wing raised in a clear, polite refusal gesture; eyes steady but slightly wide to show brave caution. Sunlight pours in from the opening, rim‑lighting both characters; the cave interior is cool blue‑gray stone with warm cream highlights and soft dust motes. Outside the opening, show a safe field path that immediately splits into a fork with a simple wooden signpost (no words) and a small olive tree under soft Aegean blue sky, hinting “another road.” Keep Cerberus imposing yet non‑threatening (no bared teeth), and Theseus calm and decisive; rounded, readable shapes and clear silhouettes. Use the series’ soft watercolor/gouache style and Greek palette (terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, warm cream) with quiet gold edge accents and generous white space around the bright exit so “leaving the cave” reads clearly.",
