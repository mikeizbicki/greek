  "art_instructions": "Medium-wide scene at child’s eye level, looking diagonally across an open, sunlit field with neat rows of short green-gold grain and a low stone wall along the far edge. Theseus (a small brown-and-olive owl) is in the left foreground, about one quarter of the page tall, walking along a narrow dirt path between rows; wings slightly open for balance, amber eyes calm and curious, olive-green travel cloak and light leather pouch visible, with a thin red cord peeking from the pouch. On the right midground stands the Man (a farmer), roughly twice Theseus’s height, turned slightly toward him with a gentle smile; he wears a simple cream chiton tied with a blue sash and a plain brimmed hat, and holds a small terracotta watering jar at his side while raising his free hand in a friendly wave. Place the Man a few steps off the path inside the field rows so it’s clear he is “in the field,” not blocking the road. Emphasize there are no monsters: open sky, wide clear spaces, no lurking shapes in grasses, hedges, or shadows. Light is warm daylight with soft edges; use the Greek palette (terracotta jar, olive greens, Aegean blue accent on the sash) and clear, readable silhouettes. Background can include one or two olive trees beyond the stone wall and distant low hills, but keep the scene simple and calm so the idea “field = safe, man present” reads instantly.",
