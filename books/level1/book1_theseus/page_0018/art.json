  "art_instructions": "Set a quiet daytime scene on the open field road: warm sunlight, a terracotta dirt path winding gently through low golden grass with a few olive leaves and tufts along the edges. Place Theseus (the small mottled brown‑and‑olive owl with an olive‑green travel cloak, side pouch, and thin red cord) slightly left of center, in profile facing right, taking a slow step with one talon lifted just above the ground and wings tucked. Show a calm, thoughtful mood: his head tipped slightly downward toward the path, wide amber eyes soft, beak relaxed; no sign of danger. Convey slowness with short, closely spaced footprints behind him, the cloak hanging straight (no flutter), and absolutely no speed lines; a tiny grass tuft lightly touches his lifted foot. Let the path stretch to the right into open fields; include a very small, softened distant figure of a man near a low stone or tool so he reads as background only. Use a child‑eye camera height with a slight three‑quarter angle so both his lifted foot and the curve of the path are visible; Theseus should occupy about one third of the picture height. Keep the palette consistent: olive greens, warm cream sky, terracotta path, with gentle gold edge light on his back; soft watercolor textures and generous white space. Add a simple waymarker stone at the path’s edge for continuity; the overall feeling is safe, unhurried walking.",
