  "art_instructions": "Render a sunlit field road continuing from the previous scene: a narrow tan dirt path between low golden grasses and a few olive trees, with a low stone wall on one side. Show Theseus (the small mottled brown‑and‑olive owl) in the foreground left, side view, running quickly toward the right; he fills about one‑third of the frame. His olive‑green travel cloak streams back, a thin red cord flicks near one leg, and his small leather pouch bounces; wings are half‑open like pumping arms, talons stretched in a long stride. His wide amber eyes are focused and cheerful, beak slightly open with a determined smile. Add tiny dust puffs at his feet, faint motion streaks on the cloak edge, and grasses leaning to suggest speed. Keep the background calm: no monsters, just the peaceful field; a tiny, unnamed human figure may stand far back by the wall, small enough not to draw focus. Use the soft watercolor/gouache style, warm daylight with gentle edge lighting, and the Greek palette (terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, warm cream).",
