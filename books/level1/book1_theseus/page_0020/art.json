  "art_instructions": "A wide, sunny field scene with a dirt path curving toward the right, edged by low dry-stone walls, olive trees, and scattered red poppies. Theseus—the small brown-and-olive owl hero—dominates the foreground, flying low above the path and moving to the right; he wears his olive-green travel cloak, a small leather pouch at his side, and a thin red cord streaming behind. Use a 3/4 side view from slightly below so he appears to surge forward. His wings are in a powerful downstroke, body angled forward, eyes bright and happy, beak slightly open in determined joy. Show that he is going even faster with bending grasses, a swirl of dust on the path, two pale motion streaks trailing his wings, and a few tiny feathers and leaves far behind; place a soft, elongated shadow under him. A small dust puff and lightly marked running footprints a short distance behind on the path hint that moments ago he was running. Keep the field calm—no monsters—just a distant line of trees and open sky, rendered in the Greek palette with warm midday light and a soft gold edge highlight. Maintain soft watercolor/gouache textures, clear friendly silhouettes, and leave generous white space near the upper left for the short Greek line.",
