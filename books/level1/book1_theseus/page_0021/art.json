  "art_instructions": "Eye-level, medium-wide scene showing the transition from country to town: on the left, a green-gold field with low grasses and a single small olive tree sits behind a low stone wall with an open gap; on the right, an open market entrance with a short colonnade and a hanging wooden tablet that reads “ἀγορά.” Place Theseus (small owl-hero) in the foreground just right of center, standing on pale stone paving with the boundary of the market clearly in front of him—one talon lifted mid-step but not yet crossing the entrance line. He is turned three-quarters toward the agora, wings folded, wearing his olive-green travel cloak; his small leather pouch and a thin red cord are visible at his side. His face is alert and relieved, eyes bright, beak slightly open as if taking a steady breath before entering. Inside the agora (in soft focus), hint at shapes of a bread basket and a tall amphora behind a stall, but keep them clearly beyond the entrance so it is obvious he is still outside. Warm daylight with Aegean blue sky; palette of terracotta columns, olive greens, and warm cream stone; gentle edge light on Theseus. No monsters or other characters; the empty field behind and the open market ahead reinforce “out of the field” and “outside the agora.”",
