  "art_instructions": "Medium-wide scene from a slightly raised angle shows the sunny edge of the agora opening into a simple plaza. In the left foreground, Theseus—the small brown‑olive owl hero in an olive-green travel cloak with a side pouch and a thin red cord—steps over a low stone threshold marked “ἀγορά,” wings tucked, head turned right toward the stalls, eyes bright with relief and curiosity; he stands about knee-high to an adult. In the mid-right, the ἔμπορος stands behind a low wooden stall under a terracotta-and-cream striped awning, smiling and ready. On the counter, make the key items large and clear: a round wicker tray with two oval loaves of bread (ἄρτος) and a tall clay water amphora with a small blue wave mark; beside it, place a bronze ladle and two small clay cups. The ἔμπορος is a friendly, middle-aged man in a light blue chiton with a short beard; he lifts one hand in greeting while the other lightly steadies the amphora. Background details stay simple: pale stone paving, a single olive tree, a low wall with a faint meander pattern, and a second distant stall silhouette to suggest the market without clutter. Light and color follow the series style: soft watercolor/gouache, warm daylight with gentle edge highlights; Greek palette of terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, and warm cream. Composition guides the eye from the threshold toward the stall with a curved shadow path so viewers read “enters the agora” and “sees the merchant with bread and water” at a glance.",
