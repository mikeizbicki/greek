  "art_instructions": "Medium, eye-level shot into a sunny corner of the agora, three-quarter view of a single stall so both faces are clear. On the left foreground stands Theseus the small owl (about knee-high to a man), cloak olive-green with a tiny leather pouch and a thin red cord peeking out; he tilts his head slightly up toward the vendor, lifts one wing in greeting, beak open in a friendly call. On the right midground, behind a low wooden stall, the ἔμπορος (marketman) faces Theseus with a warm smile; he is a middle-aged man with a short dark beard, simple cream tunic and soft Aegean-blue himation, right hand raised in a matching greeting, left hand resting near the bread. On the stall, place one large round loaf and two smaller rolls on a woven cloth with a subtle meander edge, a terracotta amphora with a small ladle, and a simple clay cup; a tiny painted sign shows a loaf and a water drop. Include a small speech ribbon by Theseus’s beak with the single Greek word «χαῖρε», to support the greeting. Background stays soft and unfussy: pale stone paving, a hint of neighboring awnings and an olive pot, no crowd, generous white space around the figures. Light is warm daytime with gentle edge highlights; Greek palette (terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, warm cream) keeps the scene calm and inviting. Keep proportions consistent (stall about the vendor’s waist-high; Theseus stands near the stall’s corner so their raised gestures mirror each other).",
