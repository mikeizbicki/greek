  "art_instructions": "Eye-level, medium shot at a simple stall in the sunny agora. On the right, the ἔμπορος—a friendly, bearded man in a cream chiton with a narrow Aegean-blue sash—stands behind a low wooden table under a woven awning, extending a round, golden-brown loaf toward Theseus with his right hand while his left rests on a basket piled with similar loaves. On the left, Theseus the small owl (mottled brown-and-olive feathers, olive-green travel cloak, thin red cord at one leg) stands on a small wooden crate to reach the counter, extending a claw with a small bronze coin toward the merchant’s hand. Their eyes meet; Theseus looks focused and content, the ἔμπορος kind and welcoming. On the tabletop, show 3–5 clear, round loaves (one half-cut to reveal soft crumb) with a few crumbs scattered. Keep the background simple: a terracotta amphora and a clay cup on a side shelf, faint silhouettes of other quiet stalls, and a small olive-branch sign to suggest the agora. Use soft daylight with warm edge lighting and the Greek palette (terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, warm cream). No crowds or monsters; clean silhouettes emphasize the action of buying (coin offered, loaf being received).",
