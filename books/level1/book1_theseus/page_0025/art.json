  "art_instructions": "Set the scene in the sunny agora at child eye level, three-quarter view. In the left foreground, Theseus (a small brown‑and‑olive owl) perches on a low stone step facing right, holding a small round loaf of bread in his talons and taking a bite; a wedge is missing and a few crumbs fall. His olive‑green travel cloak drapes neatly, a small leather pouch is visible, and a thin red cord peeks out; his wings are relaxed and his amber eyes look soft and satisfied to show “not hungry now.” On the right midground, the ἔμπορος stands behind a waist‑high wooden stall, smiling gently with hands resting on the counter as he watches the owl enjoy the bread. On the stall, place a woven basket with several round loaves and, beside it, a tall terracotta water jar with a simple Aegean‑blue band and a small clay cup (present but unused). Background hints of the agora include a warm cream whitewashed wall, a short olive tree, and the corner of another quiet stall, leaving generous open space. Use the series palette (terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, warm cream) with soft watercolor textures and warm edge lighting for calm, friendly mood. Keep Theseus the largest figure in the frame, clear silhouette and readable crumbs to support the verb “ἐσθίει.”",
