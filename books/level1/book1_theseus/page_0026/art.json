  "art_instructions": "Sunny agora scene at a simple wooden stall, shown at eye level in a three‑quarter view so the tabletop fills the lower third of the image. On the left behind the stall stands the ἔμπορος, a friendly bearded man in a cream tunic with a blue sash, smiling gently as he tilts a small clay ladle from a large terracotta hydria; the clear stream of water arcs into a small clay cup on the counter, with a tiny splash for clarity. On the right front, Theseus, a small brown‑and‑olive owl in an olive‑green travel cloak with a thin red cord at one leg and a light leather pouch at his side, perches on the stall’s edge, looking up eagerly; he extends one wing with a small coin visible to show that he buys. Make the hydria taller than Theseus to emphasize ὕδωρ, and keep the cup close to the pouring stream so the action reads instantly. On the stall, place two round loaves of bread and a neat stack of extra cups slightly to the side, while the hydria and the cup being filled sit center, the key focus. The ἔμπορος’s posture is kind and attentive; Theseus’s expression is relieved and happy. Background hints of the agora include a pale stone colonnade, an olive tree, and soft shapes of other stalls; use the Greek palette (terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, warm cream) with gentle daylight and warm edge lighting. Keep silhouettes clear and friendly, minimal text, and add a small sign on the stall with a simple water‑drop icon to cue ‘water’ without words.",
