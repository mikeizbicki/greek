  "art_instructions": "Close, eye-level scene in the sunny agora focused tightly on Theseus as he drinks. Theseus, a small owl with mottled brown-and-olive feathers, wears his olive-green travel cloak with a light leather pouch and a thin red cord looped at one leg; he stands center foreground, turned three-quarters to the right. He lifts a small clay cup with one wing-hand, head tipped slightly back so his beak touches the rim; a thin stream of water is visible entering the cup and a couple of bright droplets glint at the lip. His eyes are soft and half-closed in relief, with a tiny satisfied smile; his shoulders/wings relax to show he is no longer thirsty. Behind him to the left is a low wooden stall counter with a tall terracotta amphora labeled “ὕδωρ,” a resting ladle, a small stack of cups, and one round loaf as a familiar cue from earlier. Background details stay soft: pale cream paving, a muted Aegean-blue shade cloth overhead, and distant, unfocused market shapes so no other figure is identifiable. Use the series palette and gentle watercolor texture; add a warm edge light along the cup and beak to highlight the act of drinking.",
