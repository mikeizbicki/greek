  "art_instructions": "Set a warm daylight scene inside the agora: a simple bread-and-water stall on the right, with a wooden counter under a pale cream canopy trimmed by a faint blue meander. Frame a medium, eye‑level two‑shot: on the left foreground stands Theseus, the small brown‑and‑olive owl in his olive‑green travel cloak, leather pouch at his side, and a thin red cord peeking out; he faces the vendor with a cheerful smile, wings slightly open, one wing touching his chest in a polite bow. Above Theseus, include a small speech ribbon with the single word «εὐχαριστῶ». Behind the counter on the right is the ἔμπορος, a kind, bearded man in a simple cream chiton with a narrow blue sash; he smiles and nods, one hand over his heart while the other rests on the counter. On the counter, show two round loaves, a clay cup just used, a terracotta amphora labeled subtly with a blue band (water), and a small shallow dish with a couple of bronze coins, indicating the purchase is complete. Keep the background soft and uncluttered: light stone columns and distant, muted stalls and figures, all out of focus to keep attention on the exchange. Expressions read clearly—Theseus delighted and grateful, the ἔμπορος friendly and acknowledging. Use the Greek palette (terracotta, olive, Aegean blue, warm cream) with gentle, semi‑flat watercolor textures; no monsters or tension, only a safe, friendly marketplace moment.",
