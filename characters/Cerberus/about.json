In our stories he tests children’s choices but does not harm them.",

  "key_objects": "Bronze-studded collar; cave gate-stone; old bone toy.",
  "relationships": "Theseus: sometimes meets him on a cave path and wisely chooses another road.; Orpheus: once calmed him with a soft song so that he sat and listened.; Persephone: queen below whose gates he guards with loyal care.; Cyclops: another fierce road-blocker whom Cerberus respects from afar.; Sphinx: shares the task of testing travelers, though each keeps to a different path."
