{"name":"Cerberus_front_guard_standing.png","artist_instructions":"Front view: Cerberus leans forward in a low, wide guard, hackles raised and claws flexed; all three heads snarl with bared ivory teeth, saliva strands, and ember‑orange eye glow. The bronze‑studded collar is centered; tails hangs heavy and tense; keep the silhouette aggressive and symmetrical. Transparent background only, no props or scenery.","pose":"standing low, snarling guard","shot-angle":"front"}
{"name":"Cerberus_profile_seated_listening.png","artist_instructions":"Left profile: Cerberus coiled on his haunches, ready to spring; frontmost head growls with lips curled, middle head scents the air, rear head glares back along the spine, ears pinned. Show shaggy charcoal‑black coat, ember glows, and the bronze‑studded collar; emphasize a predatory, compressed posture. Fully transparent background, crisp silhouette.","pose":"seated coil, ready to spring","shot-angle":"profile"}
{"name":"Cerberus_topdown_curled_resting.png","artist_instructions":"Top‑down: Cerberus forms a tight trap‑coil, heavy tail wrapping toward forepaws; one head faces outward with jaws open, one up toward the viewer, one inward with teeth bared. Indicate raised hackles along the spine and subtle ember glows in the eyes; keep edges clean for animator reference. Transparent background, no ground plane.","pose":"coiled ambush, vigilant","shot-angle":"top-down"}
