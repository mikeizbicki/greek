Transparent background, no environment.","pose":"looming with club across chest","shot-angle":"front"}
{"name":"Cyclops_profile_walk_left_staff_flask","artist_instructions":"Left profile: stalking stride with knees bent and weight forward, gripping the staff as a raised club in the forward hand; the single eye cuts sideways under a heavy brow, teeth bared. Keep the rough tunic (oatmeal gray‑beige), leather belt and sandals, and visible scars; show a tense, predatory silhouette. Transparent background only.","pose":"stalking, staff raised to strike","shot-angle":"profile"}
{"name":"Cyclops_topdown_supine_nap","artist_instructions":"Top‑down: the Cyclops crouches as if over a fallen path, one hand braced on the club, single eye glaring upward toward the viewer; shoulders hunch to a powerful triangle. Maintain the same colors and garments; emphasize foreshortened limbs and a dominating, oppressive shape. Transparent background, clean contour.","pose":"crouched, looming over viewer","shot-angle":"top-down"}
