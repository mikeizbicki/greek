# Minotaur — Artist Instructions

The Minotaur is a towering, bull‑headed humanoid with forward‑curving ivory horns, red‑glowing eyes set deep beneath a heavy brow, and a dark umber‑to‑black shaggy pelt across head, shoulders, and spine. His torso is massively muscular; chest fur is sparser, showing pale scar lines; arms are long with large, veined hands ending in blunt, cracked nails; legs are digitigrade, ending in cloven hooves with coarse fetlocks. A dull bronze nose ring is always present; broken iron wrist manacles with short, jagged chains hang from both wrists. Saliva threads from bared teeth when he snarls; nostrils flare; tail flicks sharply. Color anchors: horns ivory; eyes glowing red; fur dark umber/black; scars pale beige; iron manacles dark gunmetal; ring bronze. Default posture should read predatory and menacing: shoulders forward, head lowered, horns angled toward the viewer.
