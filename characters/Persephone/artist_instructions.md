# Artist Instructions

- Draw Persephone as a small panda with black-and-white fur: white face, muzzle, chest, belly, and back; deep black ears, eye patches, shoulders, arms, and legs; black nose.  
- Her eyes are a gentle green (leaf/sage green) that should remain visible within the black eye patches.  
- She always wears a natural head wreath that changes with the season: spring—bright leaf green with pale pink blossoms; summer—deep green leaves with small white flowers; autumn—gold and copper leaves with a few red accents; winter—dark evergreen leaves with tiny pale buds.  
- Keep panda markings clean and symmetrical, and depict her without additional clothing or carried items by default.
