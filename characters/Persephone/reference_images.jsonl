{"name":"Persephone_front_neutral_spring","artist_instructions":"Draw Persephone as a small panda facing forward on a transparent background, with clean, symmetrical black-and-white markings and gentle sage-green eyes visible within the black eye patches. Place a spring wreath on her head: bright leaf-green with a few pale pink blossoms; no shawl, lantern, or extra items. Keep proportions soft and child-friendly, feet flat, arms relaxed at her sides.","pose":"standing, relaxed arms at sides","shot-angle":"front"}
{"name":"Persephone_profile_walk_winter_lantern","artist_instructions":"Show Persephone in left-profile mid-step on a transparent background, wearing her light green shawl with subtle pomegranate embroidery. She carries a tiny lantern in her forward paw; add a faint warm glow on her muzzle and shawl without affecting the background. Use a winter wreath—dark evergreen leaves with tiny pale buds—and ensure her sage-green eye is clearly visible within the black patch.","pose":"walking, holding lantern in front paw","shot-angle":"profile"}
{"name":"Persephone_topdown_wreath_detail_summer","artist_instructions":"Render a straight top-down view on a transparent background to document ear placement, head shape, and shoulder/arm black areas. Emphasize the summer wreath: deep green leaves with small white flowers arranged evenly, and keep the panda’s facial proportions readable from above (ears, eye patches, nose). No shawl or lantern; paws slightly out from the body to reveal the black shoulder saddle and symmetrical arm markings.","pose":"standing, arms slightly out to show shoulder pattern","shot-angle":"top-down"}
