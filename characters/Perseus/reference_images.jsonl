{"name":"Perseus_front_hero_stance","artist_instructions":"Draw Perseus as a small, sturdy leaf‑green dinosaur with a lighter yellow‑cream belly, lower jaw, and tail underside, dark‑brown eyes, charcoal‑gray claws, and a crisp five‑point white star on his left cheek. Front shot in a neutral T‑pose: feet shoulder‑width apart, friendly rounded‑snout smile with soft pink mouth interior, winged sandals strapped to short forefeet, travel cloak draped evenly, kibisis pouch at his side, and the mirror‑bright round shield held at his right side so its face is visible. Use a transparent background.","pose":"Neutral T‑pose, feet shoulder‑width apart","shot-angle":"front"}
{"name":"Perseus_profile_run_left","artist_instructions":"Profile shot facing left to feature the star on his left cheek as Perseus runs mid‑stride, strong hind legs pushing off and thick tail balancing, cloak streaming, and winged sandals flaring. Keep the leaf‑green body with yellow‑cream underside, dark‑brown eyes, rounded snout smile, and charcoal‑gray claws consistent, with the mirror‑bright round shield strapped across his back so the rim and strap read clearly. Use a transparent background.","pose":"Left‑facing running mid‑stride with cloak trailing","shot-angle":"profile"}
{"name":"Perseus_back_shield_raise","artist_instructions":"Back view: Perseus plants his feet and raises the mirror‑bright round shield overhead at a slight angle as if using its reflection, with his head turned a little so one eye peeks toward the viewer. Show the travel cloak’s drape, leather kibisis pouch strap crossing, winged sandals on the short forefeet, sturdy hind legs, thick tail, and hints of the yellow‑cream underside at the tail base while maintaining leaf‑green body and charcoal‑gray claws. Use a transparent background.","pose":"Shield‑raised defensive stance, slight head turn","shot-angle":"back"}
