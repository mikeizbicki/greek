# Writing Guide — Koine Greek for Young Children

Purpose: Practical, story-level guidance for writing short, child-friendly Koine Greek texts (ages 6–8). Keep language oral-first, highly repetitive, and scaffold grammar across stories.

Audience: Read-alouds by adults; echo- and choral-reading by children with no prior Greek.

Typesetting:
1. always write greek words using greek characters with appropriate diacritics
2. never include transliterations to the latin alphabet

Principles

- Keep lines very short: prefer 1–3 words per line; rarely exceed 6 words.
- Use high-frequency vocabulary repeatedly across stories.
- Present language in context (speech, song, action) rather than abstract rules.
- Introduce one small grammatical feature per story (e.g., the article, present-tense verb, or a preposition).
- Provide tiny in-line glosses (one-word English cue) and a fuller reference list at the back.
- Use phonetic support sparingly: a single-syllable guide for novel words on first encounter.

Progression (staged grammar build)

1. Stage 1 — Labels and nouns
   - Purpose: map sound → meaning.
   - Examples: ὁ παῖς (child), ἡ γλαῦξ (owl), τὸ δῶρον (gift). Use large images and single-word labels.

2. Stage 2 — Noun + verb (simple action)
   - Purpose: show who does what.
   - Templates: ὁ παῖς τρέχει. — the child runs.
   - Example phrases to reuse: ὁ παῖς βλέπει. / ἡ γλαῦξ λέγει.

3. Stage 3 — Subject + verb + object
   - Purpose: introduce direct objects and word order.
   - Template: ὁ παῖς βλέπει τὸν κυν͂α. — the child sees the dog.
   - Keep objects concrete (ball, tree, friend).

4. Stage 4 — Add one modifier or prepositional phrase
   - Purpose: expand meaning without overload.
   - Example: ὁ παῖς τρέχει πρὸς τὴν θύραν. — the child runs to the door.

5. Stage 5 — Short dialogue & refrains
   - Purpose: repetition and prosody.
   - Use a 2–4 line refrain repeated each page: e.g., Γλαῦξ: «Ἔρχομαι!» — Owl: “I come!”

Specific Greek words and short templates

- Core nouns (use images): ὁ παῖς (child), ἡ γλαῦξ (owl), ὁ ταῦρος (bull), ὁ κῆπος (garden), ὁ φίλος (friend), τὸ δῶρον (gift), ἡ οἰκία (house), ὁ λαβύρινθος (labyrinth).
- Core verbs (present, 1st or 3rd sing.): λέγω (I say), λέγει (he/she says), βλέπω / βλέπει (I/he sees), ἀκούω / ἀκούει (hear), τρέχω / τρέχει (run), ἔρχομαι / ἔρχεται (come), δίδωμι / δίδωσι(ν) (give), φοβέομαι (be afraid), χαίρω (rejoice).
- Helpful small words: καί (and), οὐ / μή (not), ναι (yes), οὖν (so), πρὸς (to/toward), ἐν (in), ὁ/ἡ/τό (the).

Short example lines (intended for echo reading)

- Γλαῦξ λέγει. — Owl says.
- Ἐγώ λέγω. — I say.
- ὁ παῖς τρέχει. — the child runs.
- ὁ ταῦρος φοβεῖται. — the bull is afraid.
- Δίδωμι δῶρον. — I give a gift.

Formatting and presentation notes

- Use large type, one simple sentence per panel, and an illustration that shows the exact action.
- Mark the speaker with an icon; place a tiny one-word gloss in the margin on first occurrence.
- Keep phonetic respellings minimal—use them only for names or unusual forms, placed in parentheses after the first instance.
- Teach one grammatical point per page spread; put a single-sentence parenthetical teacher note at the back only.

Assessment-friendly prompts (very short)

- «Τί βλέπει;» — What does (he) see?
- «Ποῖος ἔρχεται;» — Who comes?
- Ask children to echo one line, then act it (run, sit, point).

Notes on voice and register

- Use simple, present-tense narration and direct speech; avoid complex subordinate clauses.
- Prefer concrete verbs over stative or abstract vocabulary in early books.
- Keep tone warm, playful, and non-threatening; conflict is small and quickly resolved.

Cross-story vocabulary plan

- Maintain a running core list of ~40 words that recur across the series (nouns, 8–10 verbs, 6 adjectives, 6 prepositions, 6 function words).
- Reintroduce words in different contexts so meanings stabilize without explicit drilling.

End: Keep every sentence audible, repeatable, and actionable—Greek must feel usable and joyful for first-time listeners.
